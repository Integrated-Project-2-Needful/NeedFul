# NeedFul
The Needful application provides a platform for users to create separate lists of items they are donating and items they want to receive. They can then browse the market page to see what other users want to give away or what they desire. After that, they can privately chat about the details of the delivery method or the specifications of the request. The app aims to tackle Thailandâ€™s wasted resources problem from overproduction and overconsumption.
